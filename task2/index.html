        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <strong>2016:</strong>He played what was easily the best innings of his burgeoning career as India beat Australia in Mohali to advance to the semi-finals of the ICC World T20.

        <br />
        <li>

        <li>

It is time we carried him on our shoulders.”
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <strong>2009:</strong>Virat had to wait a while to get back into the national team, but it was worth it when he scored his maiden ODI century against Sri Lanka, 107 off 111
